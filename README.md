# ML Models From Scratch Exercises

This repo will contain various ML models written from scratch via a tutorial.  It just futher solidifies my understanding of how these models work.

## [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](https://github.com/AishaEvering/ML_Models_From_Scratch/blob/main/K_Nearest_Neighbors.ipynb)
   * One of the most straight forward classfication models.
   * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) operates by computing the distances between the data point in question and all other points in the dataset. It then identifies the top 'k' (a hyperparameter) closest neighbors and determines the appropriate label based on the majority label among these neighbors.
   * Make sure the k is an odd number to avoid ties for majority.
